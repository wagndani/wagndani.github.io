        <h2>Georgia On My Mind</h2>

        <p>North Georgia specifically.  One of my favorite places to go within a few hours drive of home is the mountains and hills of northern Georgia in the fall.  There is a popular pumpkin patch just outside of Dawsonville, GA we have made a tradition to visit annually.  So, lets see what we can find nearby...</p>

        <p>I'll start by entering Dawonsonville, GA into <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dawsonville,+GA+30534/@34.4301817,-84.1290074,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x885f7cdcdd2ba817:0x96cb0430ad709640!8m2!3d34.4210713!4d-84.1192245">Google Maps.</a>  If I take a look at the pane that pops up on the left side of the page, and the address bar, I have information for the zip code, latitude and longitude for Dawsonville, GA.  Now, looking back at the documentation for the RIDB under <a href="http://usda.github.io/RIDB/#Get All Recreation Areas">"Get All Recreation Areas"</a> we find a listing of available "URL Parameters".  We can use these parameters to filter through all the records in the RIDB to those which are specific to our needs.  If I were interested in retriving records near a specific location, I can see that the "latitude", "longitude", and "radius" parameters will fit the purpose. </p>

        <P>I'll start by creating an object populated with the data I found on Google Maps for Dawsonville, and a variable to hold the distance (miles) I am willing to search: <pre>
        var Dawsonville = {
            latitude:34.43018,
            longitude:-84.12900,
            zipCode:30534,
            state:"Georgia",
            stateAbbrev:"GA"
        }

        var distance = 50;          /*50 miles being the max distance I can travel without complaints from the back seat*/</pre></p>

        <p>Now, modify the request from the organization pull from the previous page, using the latitude, longitude, and radius parameters by appending them into the URL with the ampersand (&amp;):<pre>
        req.open('GET', 'https://ridb.recreation.gov/api/v1/recareas/?latitude=' + Dawsonville.latitude + "&longitude=" + Dawsonville.longitude + "&radius=" + distance + "&" + MyapiKey , true);</pre></p>

        <p>Looking through the return, You may notice a few attributes of particular interest: <code>RecAreaName:</code>, <code>RecAreDescription:</code>, <code>RecAreaDirections:</code>, <code>keywords:</code>, and <code>RecAreaPhone:</code> all look to be good resource information.  Lets do something with it.</p>

        <h3>Adding the information to a website</h3>
        <p>We have seen how to create a <code>GET</code> request and how to store the response in a variable, let's review: <pre>

/*Create an object of our target location*/
    var Dawsonville = {
        latitude:34.43018,
        longitude:-84.12900,
        zipCode:30534,
        state:"Georgia",
        stateAbbrev:"GA"
        }

/*Create a variable to store a specific distance from our target location*/
    var distance = 50;

/*Create the request*/
    var recAreaRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();

/*Define the query*/
    recAreaRequest.open('GET', 'https://ridb.recreation.gov/api/v1/recareas/?latitude=' + Dawsonville.latitude + "&amp;longitude=" + Dawsonville.longitude + "&amp;radius=" + distance + "&amp;" + MyapiKey , true);

/*add an event listener and output object information to the console window*/
    recAreaRequest.addEventListener('load', function(){
        if (recAreaRequest.status &gt;= 200 &amp;&amp; recAreaRequest.status &lt; 400){
            var dataCollected = JSON.parse(recAreaRequest.responseText);
            var targetObjects = dataCollected.RECDATA;
            console.log(targetObjects);
        }

        else {
            console.log("Error in network request: " + recAreaRequest.statusText);
        }
    ;}

    recAreaRequest.send(null);</pre>
    </p>

    <p>This will output the object array of recreation areas to the console.</p>
    <img src="completedImages/recAreaConsoleOut.png">
    <p>Now, let's modify the code to output this data to the browser, but before we do, we need to define a few more concepts.</p>

    <p><code>var _someName = document.createElement("HTMLelement");</code> This will create a new HTML element of the defined type (ie. <code>("div")</code> will create a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>) and assign it to the variable <code>_someName</code>.</p>

    <p>The text within that new element can be created by calling <code>_someName.textContent = "Here is some text";</code> or if the JSON parsed string contains HTML tags within its body, then <code>_someName.innerHTML = "&lt;strong&gt;This text will be bold &lt;/strong&gt;"</code></p>

    <p>To assign an elements text with the contents of an object instead of hardcoded strings, simply use the dot notation followed by the property name to access the description.  For example using the Dawsonville object above the assignment <code>_someName.textContent = Dawsonville.State</code> will assign the string <code>Georgia</code> to the text content of <code>_someName</code>.</p>

    <p>Now that we have created an element with something to display, we add it to the HTML document by appending the new element to some existing HTML element.  You can append the new element into the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> by using <code>document.body.appendChild(_someName);</code>.  Or if you have a specific place you need the element to be placed and you have another tag with a unique id you can use <code>document.getElementByID('elementID').appendChild(_someName);</code>.  For example, you may have a tag with a id as such: <code>&lt;div id='put_someNameHere&gt;</code> and you can access it by calling <code>document.getElementById('put_someNameHere').appendChild(_someName);</code></p>

    <p>Let's add one final building block before we do anything amazing.  Let's talk about <code>arrayName.forEach();</code>  JavaScript contains a built in method for array called <code>forEach();</code>.  This will allow you to pass in a function and do some action to each element of an array.  Similar to a <code>for</code> loop.  The two functions below are equalivant</p>

    <pre>
    var CityList = [
    {name: "Dawsonville",
    activity: "pumpkin patch",
    priority: 1},
    {name: "Ellijay",
    activity: "apple orchard",
    priority: 2},
    {name: "Blue Ridge",
    activity: "hiking",
    priority: 3}
    ];

    for (var i = 0; i &lt;CityList.length; i++){
        console.log(CityList[i].activity);
    }

    CityList.forEach(function (element){
        console.log(element.activity);
    });

    /*Console output of both will be the same.
    pumpkin patch
    apple orchard
    hiking
    </pre>

    <p>Now we are finally ready to do something productive with our information we recieved from RIDB.  Going back to our Object we created from our JSON return from the RIDB response, we see that we are dealing with an array of objects, and each object contains keys (property attributes) for the area name, description, directions, and phone number.  Let's use this information to autogenerate a webpage for rec areas within 50 miles of Dawsonville, GA.</p>

    <pre>
    var Dawsonville = {
        latitude:34.43018,
        longitude:-84.12900,
        zipCode:30534,
        state:"Georgia",
        stateAbbrev:"GA"
    }

var distance = 50;


    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();

        req.open('GET', 'https://ridb.recreation.gov/api/v1/recareas/?latitude=' + Dawsonville.latitude + "&amp;longitude=" + Dawsonville.longitude + "&amp;radius=" + distance + "&amp;" + MyapiKey , true);
                req.addEventListener('load', function(){
                    if (req.status &gt;= 200 &amp;&amp; req.status &lt; 400){
                        var dataCollected = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
                        var targetObjects = dataCollected.RECDATA;
                        console.log(targetObjects);

                  /*The following code with create a div for each object in the retured array.
                  Each div will contain a h3 header for the area name, a block for the rec area
                  description, a block for directions to the rec area, and a contact phone number.
                  The div for each area (oject) will then be added to the HTML body*/

                  targetObjects.forEach(function(element){
                        var newRecOpp = document.createElement("div");

                        var newRecOppHeader = document.createElement("h3");

                            newRecOpp.style.border = 'solid';

                            var aboutAreaText = document.createElement("p");
                            aboutAreaText.innerHTML = element.RecAreaDescription;
                            newRecOpp.appendChild(aboutArea);
                            newRecOpp.appendChild(aboutAreaText);


                        var directions = document.createElement("h4");

                            directionsText.textContent = element.RecAreaDirections;
                            newRecOpp.appendChild(directions);
                            newRecOpp.appendChild(directionsText);


                        var contactInfo = document.createElement("h4");
                            contactInfo.textContent = "Contact:";
                            var contactText = document.createElement("p");
