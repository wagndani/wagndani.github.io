    <h2>The Recreation Information Database - RIDB</h2>
    <p>The Recreation Information Database (RIDB) provides users with a vast resource of information regarding recreational opportunities, across numerous Federal land management agencies, as well as state parks.  Information is able to be queried by state, activity, managment agency.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov">RIBD.RECREATION.GOV</a> has provided a RESTful API to allow developers to access this wealth of information.  The possibilitiies are seemingly endless.  A rental cabin agency in the Smoky Mountains can use this information within their own websites to provide potential vacation renters with nearby site seeing opportunities.  A bait shop could identify nearby public fishing locations.  Outdoor adventure suppliers can provide potential clients with information on local camping, hiking or canoeing opportunities.  A local Tourism Development Council can use the information in efforts to attract more visitors to their cities.  A travel guide can use the data to find handicap accessible campsites for disabled clients, for find all the historical tours that leave at specific times or date ranges.  Mountain bike groups can deterime with trails allow mounitan bike usage, as well as the width, length, and surface type of those trails.  Without a question, the enterprising developer can do a great deal with this data.</p>
   
    <h2>RESTful API</h2>
    <p>A RESTful API is an Aplication Program Interface (API) that uses representational state transer (REST) protocols to utilize HTML requests to GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE data.  GET requests are generally provided in a Javascript Object Notation (JSON) format or extensible Markup Language (XML).  These requests can then be process to taylor to a specifc need.  In short, RESTFUL APIs allow programmers to retrieve and process information, from other servers, to use and display within their own websites or applications. </p>
